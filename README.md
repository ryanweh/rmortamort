# Reverse Mortgage Amortization

A learning project for D3.js, this simple page will calculate, chart, and graph mortgage values given initial loan conditions for a reverse mortgage.  Hopefully it can help you decide if a reverse mortgage makes sense in your situation.

## Getting Started

Everything is local HTML and Javascript, so you do not need a web server to view.  The d3.js library is included and is a fairly recent version of d3 as of the initial commit.  The three pieces to view the page are the data/amortdata.json file, and the d3/d3.js file, and the rmortamort.htm file itself.

The data/amortdata.json file is gitignored, so you can make changes to it to load your own initial conditions.

### Prerequisites

You can simply download the entire rmortamort project to get the necessary files.

## Deployment

Some changes will be needed to make the project worthy of live deployment.
