# Reverse Mortgage Amortization

A learning project for D3.js, this simple page will calculate, chart, and graph mortgage values given initial loan conditions for a reverse mortgage.  Hopefully it can help you decide if a reverse mortgage makes sense in your situation.

## Getting Started

Everything is local HTML and Javascript, so you do not need a web server to view.  The d3.js library is included and is a fairly recent version of d3 as of the initial commit.  The three pieces to view the page are the data/amortdata.json file, and the d3/d3.js file, and the rmortamort.htm file itself.

The data/privatedata.json file is gitignored, if you copy amortdata.json to this file, values in it will be used so you can load your own initial conditions without them being pushed back into the repository.

### Prerequisites

You can simply download the entire rmortamort project to get the necessary files.

## Deployment

Some changes will be needed to make the project worthy of live deployment.
